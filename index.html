		<p>
			Mahjong or mah-jongg (English pronunciation: /mɑːˈdʒɒŋ/ mah-JONG, Mandarin Chinese: [mǎ.tɕjâŋ]) is a tile-based game that was developed during the Qing dynasty in China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia).
		</p>
		<p>
			The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been adapted into a widespread online entertainment. Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and luck.
