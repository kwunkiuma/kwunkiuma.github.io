			The Dealer starts by taking the first tile (see diagram for first tile. NB the game sometimes seems to
			generate an empty column in the middle of the tiles. Ignore this). They must then discard a tile (this may
			be the tile that was just picked up). Essentially every player should have 13 tiles in their hand before and
			after each round. Play continues anticlockwise.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next player picks up a tile (you’d take the tile in the bottom row before moving onto the next column in
			the order), and then discards a tile to the centre, face up. Repeat this step with the next player. Unless
			someone wants to take the discarded tile:

		<div class="heading">
			Taking discarded tiles
		</div>
		<p>
			There are 4 situations where you are allowed to take a tile that someone else has just discarded, the first
			two more common than the last two:
		</p>
		<p>
			Triplet: If any player discards a tile which is identical to two tiles in your hand, you can say ‘pohng’ and
			pick it up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sequence: If the player immediately before you (i.e. they are to your left on the table) discards a tile
			which forms a sequence of three with two of your tiles (all of the same suite), you can say ‘chow’ and pick
			it up and place those three tiles on the table. (E.g. 1-2-3, …, 7-8-9. This does not wrap around, and there
			are no sequences for the winds or dragons).
		</p>
		<p>
			4-of-a-kind: If you already have three of the same tile in your hand, and any player discards the 4th tile
			(there are only 4 of each tile in the whole game), you can say ‘gong’ and pick up that tile. You now need an
			extra tile - pick up the tile from the end of the chain in the middle of the table - i.e. the opposite end
			of where the next person would normally pick up the next tile.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you take a discarded tile for any of these 3 reasons, you must place the group of 3 (or 4) tiles on the
			table on your right, face up so that they are visible for everyone. (The website does this automatically for
			you if you drag the tiles just to the right of your hand).
		</p>
		<p>
			After picking up a discarded tile and putting the tiles out, you must discard one of the tiles in your hand.
			Remember you must always have 13 tiles in total after your round (unless you have a 4-of-a-kind). Play then
			continues with the next person anticlockwise (so may have skipped some people in between).
		</p>
		<p>
			And the last situation:
		</p>
		<p>
			Winning the game: You can take the discarded tile when you have a winning hand. You say ‘mahjong’ and reveal
			your hand. The game ends here. How do you win? Read on:
		</p>

		<div class="heading">
			Winning the game
		</div>
		<p>
			To win the game, you will (in most cases) need 4 sets of three tiles (either triplets or sequences as
			above), as well as a pair of the same tile (totalling 14 tiles). You may know that you have a winning hand
			when you are looking to discard a tile but you actually cannot find one to discard. At
